# COMP30023-project-1

Project 1 for COMP30023 - Computer Systems, Deadlock detection and breaking.

## Overview

The basic implementation involves determining the current resourse allocation of the files and processes to identify whether a deadlock will occur. If there is no deadlock, the minimum execution time of all the processes is calculated, while if a deadlock is detected, the processes that have to terminated are identified and terminated.

Assessor comments:

Excellent, descriptive commit messages

Good use of data structures

Well modularised

Good, descriptive comments

Report exists, is <= 50 words, simulation time improved on at least 1 case

Lacking explanation of why algorithm is better than default (-0.25)
